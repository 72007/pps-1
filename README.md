# billing sytem

The Billing System Project is a basic console application developed to showcase the practical application of the C programming language. It is designed for use in various retail settings like departmental stores, shops, or cafes to manage customer billing efficiently.

This application allows for the management of customer records including name, address, mobile number, payment details, and due amounts. It offers features to add, edit, and search customer accounts, making it useful for both new and returning customers.

The C source code of this project uses user-defined functions and structures extensively. Key functions like `input()`, `writefile()`, `search()`, and `output()` are employed for tasks such as adding new customer accounts, storing data in a file, searching for customer records, and displaying output respectively.

The program utilizes structures to organize data logically. For instance, date-related variables are grouped under a `date` structure, while customer information like name, phone number, and payment details are grouped under an `account` structure.

Upon running the application, users are presented with options to add an account, search for an account, or exit. Input prompts guide users through the process based on their chosen option.

Notable features include:
- Ability to manage multiple customer accounts.
- Flexibility to add accounts dynamically.
- Calculation functionalities for due amounts and balances integrated within the code.
- Search capabilities based on customer name or number.

While this project serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding C programming concepts like user-defined functions and structures, it's important to note that submitting this code without modification as a school or college project is discouraged. The application file generated by this project can be used practically, while the source code can be studied to deepen one's understanding of C programming fundamentals.
